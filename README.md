# RocketTrades

## Description

The idea behind Rocket Trades is simple, we want to help the investors to follow their favorite U.S. stocks and cryptocurrencies. Why? Because during the Covid-19 pandemic we saw a surge of the cryptocurrrencies market and also a significant increment of new young investors in the stock market. Also, we fill that in some apps the info of your portfolio is not so easy to follow, so our idea is to provide the most simple information to our users. The information we want to provide are 4 elements, the name of the stock or cryptocurrency, their symbol in whiche they will find it registered, the price for each unit and the daily change in percentage.
